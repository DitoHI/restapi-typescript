### Boilerplate for ToDoApp

Let's forget the daunting process of setting up the model, routes, controller, etc

#### What Uses ?

The starting model is users and items *(on process)*. You can modify as you prefer in the model and controller inside the folder

#### What to do ?
* Not bothering to put jwt middleware in every endpoint of route, we want to implement `passport` in the future
